## Math League #5
Some problems from the Wisconsin Math Leauge. I scored 6/6! :D
Riju and I agreed that it was probably the easiest one so far this year,
though the last one still requires some thinking.
I waited 24 hours to post this, and I hope that is a good grace period for the problems.

While this is really just a change in base exercise and then plugging it into a calculator for most people,
we can still bound it without a calculator and get the answer. I'll assume you have gotten to this point,

$$ n < \frac{\log{\frac{1}{10}}}{\log{\frac{1}{3}}} < n+1.$$

Set the base equal to $\frac{1}{3}$ to make the bottom part dissapear:

$$ n < \log_{\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{10}} <n+1.$$

Past this all you need to know is that $\log_{\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{10}}$ is somewhere between
$\log_{\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{9}} =2$ and $\log_{\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{27}} =3$, so $n=2$. We're done.

We start by letting the two integer roots be $p,q$. After expanding $(x-p)(x-q)$, we find that

$$ x^2 + (-q-p)x +qp = 0.$$

We make the coefficient of the first equation $1$ by dividing it by $r$

$$ x^2 + \frac{r-2}{r}x + \frac{r+2}{r} = 0.$$

So we want the coefficents of these two equations to be the same, yeilding

$$ -q-p = \frac{r-2}{r} \qquad\qquad qp = \frac{r+2}{r} $$

The key point here is that we can solve both equations for $2$, hopefully removing the constants.

$$ (p+q+1)r = 2 \qquad\qquad (qp-1)r = 2.$$

Then finally setting these equal to each other, and dividing $r$, which is indeed possible because $r\neq 0 $:

$$ p+q+1 = qp-1.$$

The $p$, $q$ and $qp$ along with the fact that we are finding *integer* solutions screamed Simon's favorite
factoring trick.

$$
\begin{align*}
0 &= qp - p - q - 2 \\
0 &= (q-1)(p-1)-1-2 \\
3 & = (q-1)(p-1).
\end{align*}
$$

The solution is so close... we notice that the only way to get $3$ with integers is $(1,3),(3,1),(-1,-3)(-3,-1)$
(the last few negative ones almost messed me up because I missed them). Also note that the switching the
pair does not do anything, as $q$ and $p$ will just swap, which has no affect on our value of $r$.

| $p-1$ | $q-1$ |
|-------|-------|
| $1$   | $3$   |
| $-1$  | $-3$  |

Solving for $p$, and $q$ (which I will leave as an exercise for the reader), we plug each value back into
$ (p+q+1)r = 2 $ from before to get our two values of $r$: $\boxed{-2, \frac{2}{7}}$.
